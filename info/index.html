			Jazz.Computer is an interactive song that responds to the position and direction of your scrolling. 
		</div>

		<h3>Interaction</h3>
		<div>
			Scrolling is the first thing you do when you wake up and the last thing that you do before you go to sleep. Like our other project <a href="http://scroll-o-meter.club" target="_blank">Scroll-O-Meter</a>, Jazz.Computer makes scrolling the subject.
		</div>

		<h3>Music</h3>
		<div>
			A typical song will play beginning to end the same way every time, Jazz.Computer is a potentially endless song with infinite variation. Instruments, effects, tempo, chords and sections respond to the distance and direction of your scrolling and your position on the page. 
			<br><br>
			At the top of the page, the song is at 130 bpm and 65 bpm at the bottom. Correspondingly, the arrangement of the song also changes with the tempo. The sounds of instruments and effects are interpolated in a similar way, like keyframes or automation points.
			<br><br>
			The chord progression is handled differently in order to feel like the chords always moving forward. A <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov Chain</a> describes how chords transition from the current chord to the next (pictured below).
			<br>
			<img src="./images/UpDownChords.png">
			<br>
			After you scroll a certain distance, the song will transition to the B Section where the chords are flipped and the top of the page uses the chords from the bottom.
			<br><br>
			To get a better sense of what's going on under the hood, check out <a href="http://jazz.computer/#GUI" target="_blank">http://jazz.computer/#GUI</a>. A few instances of Dat.GUI will appear and give you control over a lot of the instruments and effects. It's not very well organized, but might be fun to mess around with. 
		</div>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<div>
			Everything in Jazz.Computer is synthesized and effected live. The only sample is the voice, which is pre-recorded but triggered and effected in real-time. This is made possible with a recent browser technology called the <a href="http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/">Web Audio API</a> and a library built with this API called <a href="http://tonejs.org" target="_blank">Tone.js</a>. 

			<br><br>
			I developed Tone.js in order to realize ambitious interactive songs like Jazz.Computer. Tone allows a developer to produce and arrange music entirely in the browser. 
		</div>

		<h3>Visuals</h3>
		<div>
			The visuals follow the music closely and apply a few of the same techniques. Each instrument has a corresponding visual element which is triggered along with that instrument. The colors, sizes and animation speeds are interpolated in a similar way to the effects using preset interpolation. 
			<br><br>
			The visuals were created using a combination of generative graphics with <a href="http://threejs.org" target="_blank">three.js</a> and stop motion animation. The color blending was created with a simple custom shader to create unique color combinations where shapes overlap. 
		</div>

		<h3>Interactive Music</h3>
		<div>
			Unlike an "interactive music video", both the visuals <i>and</i> the music affected by the user. Jazz.Computer is just one example of the possibilities of creating music interactively with listeners.
			<br><br>
			Future work will focus on producing more interactive music as well as building tools which will lower the barrier of entry and enable other people to create interactive music as the technology and techniques mature.
